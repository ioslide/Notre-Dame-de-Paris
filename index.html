            treasures from the 13th to 17th centuries hidden in the hall, are well-known throughout the world and are
            the symbols of ancient Paris. Although it is a religious building, it shines with the wisdom of the French

                epoch-making symbol in the history of European architecture. Before it, most church buildings were bulky
                and vulgar, with heavy vaults, stubby pillars, thick walls and dark spaces. Notre Dame de Paris broke
                through the old bondage and created a new lightweight skeleton voucher. This structure lightened the
                vault, raised the space, and provided ample light.</p>

            of buttress composed of an arch that extends from the upper portion of a wall to a pier of great mass, in
            order to convey to the ground the lateral forces that push a wall outwards, which are forces that arise from
            vaulted ceilings of stone and from wind-loading on roofs</p>

              it is not in contact with the wall at ground level, unlike a traditional buttress, and so transmits the
              lateral forces across the span of intervening space between the wall and the pier. To provide lateral
              support, flying-buttress systems are composed of two parts: a massive pier, a vertical block of masonry
              situated away from the building wall, and an arch that bridges the span between the pier and the wall —
              either a segmental arch or a quadrant arch — the flyer of the flying buttress.</p>

          <p class="body preLine"> The statue was commissioned for, and remains in the Cathedral of Notre Dame in
            Paris,where it survived the 2019 Notre Dame fire.It is an example of the court style in Late Gothic
            sculpture. The Virgin of Paris is a new style that is different from the classical contrapposto and is
            sometimes called one of the most decorative statues in all of Catholicism. It is in honour of the Blessed
            Virgin, mother of Jesus.It retains an emotional appeal that links it to the Strasbourg Death of the
            Virgin.<br /> In this sculpture, Mary is shown standing, holding her son, Jesus Christ, against her body.
            Unlike previous renditions of this couple, both are naturalistic, with recognizable facial features. As
            usual in most religious sculptural depictions of the Holy mother and child of this time, Jesus does not look
            like a baby, but rather a miniature adult. <br /> However, the artist tried to combat this by giving the
            child the mannerisms of an infant as he plays with his mother’s veil and holds a ball. Mary stands in royal
            dress and a crown, depicting her as royalty. The ball her son holds is also an allusion to their royalty and
            holiness.The ball or orb in Christ’s hands is a reference to Christ as Salvator Mundi, or Saviour of the
            World. The orb symbolizes Earth, and how Christ is king of the entire world.</p>

            Christians or Mar Thoma Nazranis. After his death, the reputed relics of Saint Thomas the Apostle were
            enshrined as far as Mesopotamia in the 3rd century,and later moved to various places.In 1258, some of the
            relics were brought to Ortona, in Abruzzo,Italy, where they have been held in the Church of Saint Thomas the

            <p class="body modal--anim-js preLine">Saint Denis was a legendary 3rd-century Christian martyr and
              saint.According to his hagiographies, he was bishop of Paris in the third century and, together with his
              companions Rusticus and Eleutherius, was martyred for his faith by decapitation. Some accounts placed this
              during Domitian's persecution and identified St Denis of Paris with the Areopagite who was converted by St
              Paul and who served as the first bishop of Athens. Assuming Denis's historicity, it is now considered more
              likely that he suffered under the persecution of the emperor Decius shortly after ad 250. </p>

            <p class="body modal--anim-js preLine">Denis is the most famous cephalophore in Christian legend, with a
              popular story claiming that the decapitated bishop picked up his head and walked several miles while
              preaching a sermon on repentance. He is venerated in the Catholic Church as the patron saint of France and
              Paris and is accounted one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers. A chapel was raised at the site of his burial by
              a local Christian woman; it was later expanded into an abbey and basilica, around which grew up the French
              city of Saint-Denis, now a suburb of Paris.</p>

          <p class="body preLine">The strix (plural striges or strixes), in the mythology of classical antiquity, was a
            bird of ill omen, the product of metamorphosis, that fed on human flesh and blood. It also referred to
            witches and related malevolent folkloric beings. <br /> In architecture, a gargoyle is a
            carved or formed grotesque:6–8 with a spout designed to convey water from a roof and away from the side
            of a building, thereby preventing rainwater from running down masonry walls and eroding the mortar between.
            Architects often used multiple gargoyles on a building to divide the flow of rainwater off the roof to
            minimize the potential damage from a rainstorm. A trough is cut in the back of the gargoyle and rainwater
            typically exits through the open mouth. Gargoyles are usually an elongated fantastical animal because the
            length of the gargoyle determines how far water is directed from the wall. When Gothic flying buttresses
            were used, aqueducts were sometimes cut into the buttress to divert water over the aisle walls <br /> The
            Chimera (/kɪˈmɪərə/ or /kaɪˈmɪərə/, also Chimaera (Chim&aelig;ra); Greek: Χίμαιρα, Ch&iacute;maira
            &quot;she-goat&quot;) according to writers, was a fire-breathing hybrid creature of Lycia in Asia
            Minor,composed of the parts of more than one animal. It is usually depicted as a lion, with the head of a
            goat arising from its back, and a tail that might end with a snake's head,[1] and was one of the offspring
            of Typhon and Echidna and a sibling of such monsters as Cerberus and the Lernaean Hydra.</p>
